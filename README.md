# Car-Rental-System

Public transportation by Road is the most used means of transportation in india and a lot of people prefer private vehicles as a means but many of the times the need for the transportation is limited to a time period so instead of wasting resources on buying new private vehicles we can easily save a huge chunk of it by making it one time use transportation by renting one vehicle.
Renting commodities is very common nowadays with increasing digital transactions and ease of payments.Our aim is to create a system software where we can list cars for rent with their details and a customer can rent the car with a fixed fair rate and handle all this information powered by Relational Databases.
Features of the Software :- [ Login/LogOut, Adding a New Car/Deleting, Updating, Searching, Your Drives, Renting, Returning, Date, Fair].
These Features will have a good graphical interface for any party to indulge with to make it more user friendly.
